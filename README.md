# BLUME API

This project aims to provide a RESTful API for getting the air data from the official measuring points from the [Berliner Luftg√ºtemessnetz](https://luftdaten.berlin.de/lqi) (BLUME).
The data is only available on their website or as CSV-files. So in order to fetch the data, we are going to scrape the website and then make the data available through endpoints that will be documented here.
